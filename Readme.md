# Introduction

Matrix-matrix multiplication is at the core of much of scientific computing. Despite many years of research, there are still open questions about the most efficient implementation mechanism. 

Lots of matrices that we encounter in the wild are sparse. That is, they contain many zero entries. In the limit of very large matrices, we do not have the memory to store them in a dense format. Even if we did, performing a matrix-matrix multiplication on this format would carry out a large amount of unnecessary computation. Moreover, many sparse matrices tend to exhibit some structure: large blocks of the matrix are completely empty (only zeroes), while other parts are quite populated. Many sparse matrices contain structured dense subblocks.
As an example, consider multiplying two n Ã— n diagonal matrices. If we store them densely, this requires 2n^3 operations, whereas a sparse format would only require 2n operations.

This repository contains code written in C for optimised sparse matrix-matrix addition and multiplication for a 3rd year Assignment as part of my Masters Degree in Computer Science.

## Usage

Sample matrices are provided in the zip files.

The makefile contains lines that can be commented/uncommented in order to compile with a different compiler/flags. The Intel Compiler (ICC) provides the fastest binaries for scalar compilation, but to generate a parallelised compilation, the PGI compiler must be used.

```bash
cd GPU_Compute
make
```

The implemented functionality for sparse matrices are as follows:
* matrix-matrix multiplication
    * A * B
* matrix-matrix addition followed by multiplication:
    * (A + B + C) * (D + E + F)
    
 To perform either operation use:
 ``` 
 ./sparsemm M1 M2 output.matrix
 ./sparsemm M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 output.matrix
 ```
 where `M1-M6` are input matrices from the sample zip files, and `output.matrix` specifies the name of the output file.
